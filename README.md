<h2>Introduction:</h2>

I've developed a replica of Amazon's homepage using HTML and CSS, focusing on front-end development. This project demonstrates my ability to design and style a complex layout, incorporating navigation bars, product grids, and footer sections to mimic the original Amazon interface closely. Explore the code to see how I implemented these features to create a visually appealing and functional homepage.

<h2>Steps to run the Amazon clone project are below:</h2>
1. Install XAMPP. <br>
2. Find the htdocs folder in the XAMPP installation directory and paste all the contents of this folder into it. <br>
3. Run the XAMPP control panel. <br>
4. Start Apache and MySQL services. <br>
